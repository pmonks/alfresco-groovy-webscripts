Pre-requisites
--------------
* Alfresco (Labs or Enterprise) v3.0 or greater (earlier versions of Alfresco
  bundle a version of Spring that doesn't support Groovy beans).

* The "Common" Groovy backed Web Script module has been installed (see
  https://forge.alfresco.com/svn/groovy/branches/3.1/Common/readme.txt for
  details).


Installation
------------
1. Copy the *contents* of the /src/main/resources/alfresco/extension directory
   to ${ALFRESCO_HOME}/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension

NOTE: This code is not intended for production use and should not be installed
on a production system.


Running the Example
-------------------
1. Start Alfresco
2. Browse to http://[alfresco_host]:[alfresco_port]/alfresco/s/groovy/helloworld
3. Login as an admin user


Testing Hot Redeployment
------------------------
While Alfresco is still running:
1. Open ${ALFRESCO_HOME}/tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension/groovy/webscripts/HelloWorldGroovyWebScript.groovy
   in a text editor
2. Change the greeting
3. Save the file
4. Refresh http://[alfresco_host]:[alfresco_port]/alfresco/s/groovy/helloworld
   in your browser
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 several times
6. Bask in the knowledge that you didn't have to restart Alfresco at all
   during this process!  :-)


TODO
----
* Demonstrate use of ServiceRegistry and/or other Alfresco APIs from within
  the Groovy script.
* Demonstrate use of Javascript in conjunction with this Web Script (it's
  based on the DeclarativeWebScript class, which supports mixed Java /
  Javascript / Freemarker Web Scripts).
